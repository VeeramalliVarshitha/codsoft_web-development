            <h3>AI-ML Based Safety Detector </h3>
            <p>The aim of an AI-ML based detector is to detect whether a person is wearing a safety kit or not using machine learning algorithms. 
            The objective is to increase safety and compliance with helmet laws, particularly in environments such as construction sites, manufacturing plants, and motorcycle riding. 
            The system can be integrated with cameras and sensors to automatically detect and alert workers or riders who are not wearing helmets, and potentially even enforce safety measures such as locking gates or denying access to certain areas. Additionally, it can be used to monitor compliance and track usage data for safety training and compliance reporting.
